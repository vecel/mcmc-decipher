# MCMC Decipher
An exploration of using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to break substitution ciphers - a classic encryption technique where each letter is replaced with another. This project demonstrates how probabilistic modeling and MCMC sampling can be applied to decrypt encoded text by learning likely letter mappings based on language patterns.
